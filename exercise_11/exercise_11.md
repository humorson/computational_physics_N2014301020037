##abstract    
 * Study the behavior of our model for Hyperion for different initial conditions.   
Estimate the Lyapunov exponent from calculations of ![](https://github.com/humorson/computational_physics_N2014301020037/blob/master/01.png)  
And examine how this exponent varies as a function of the eccentricity of the orbit.
