**as what we can see from the diagram,the trajectories with constant g and with varing gravity due to altitude are almost the same,and    
their landing locations are less than 26 meters away from each other, which is ignorable comparing with ranges**
#conclusions
####1.when it is a short distance cannon launching, we can ignore how altitude affect on gravity
####2.air resistance have a strong affect on the trajectory
