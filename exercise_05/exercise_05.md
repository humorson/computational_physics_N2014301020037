###the next is the result

**as what we can see from the diagram,the trajectories with constant g and with varing gravity with altitude are almost the same,and    
the their landing locations are less than 25meters away from each other,which is gnorable comparing with ranges**
#conclusions
####1.when it is a short distence cannon launching,we can ignore how altitude affect on gravity
####2.air resistance have a strong affect on the trajectory
